# Snake Game 🐍

A recreation of the classic Snake Game using the Turtle Library and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python.

## ⚠️ Important 

- **Do not delete** the file named `data.txt`. This file is essential for the program to run correctly, as it stores the highest score.

## 📘 How Does It Work?

### 1. Start the Game:  
   - After executing, the program will ask if you want to play.  
   - You will have to enter `Y` for **Yes** or `N` for **No`.  
   - The input is not case-sensitive, but it must be a single valid character.

### 2. Control the Snake:  
   - **Move Left**: Press the **Left Arrow Key**.
   - **Move Right**: Press the **Right Arrow Key**.  
   - **Move Up**: Press the **Up Arrow Key**.
   - **Move Down**: Press the **Down Arrow Key**.

### 3. Save Your High Score:  
   - The program automatically saves your highest score in a file named `data.txt`.

## 💡 Notes

- The file error was added intentionally—oops! 🤷‍♂️
