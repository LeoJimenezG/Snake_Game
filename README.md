# Snake_Game
The classic Snake Game using Turtle library and OOP

--- IMPORTANT: Do not delete the file named "data.txt", otherwise the program will not execute properly --- 

- The program will initialy ask if the user wants to play ("Y" or "N")
- It won't matter if the entry is lower or upper case, but it has to be a single valid character
- To move left, press "LeftArrow"
- To move right, press "RightArrow"
- To move up, press "UpArrow"
- To move down, press "DownArrow"
- The program will save in a file named "data.txt" the highest score


Note: I left the file error on purpose, ups.
